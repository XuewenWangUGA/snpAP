0.3.5
- link nlopt dynamically (compiles on new Ubuntu)
- allow file or string for priors when running snpADcall 

0.3.4
- snpADci to calculate box confidence intervals. 
  Use -M when you want to sum over the individual confidence 
  intervals of heterozygous genotypes to get confidence intervals on 
  heterozygosity.
- new option -min_gtfreq for snpAD. Use this option if you analyze 
  samples with high heterozygosity (>>1e-4) or if you genotype data
  that is enriched for heterozygous sites (e.g. capture data of known SNPs).
- fixed bug that caused segfault. Thanks to Stephen Clayton for reporting!

0.3.3
- print Genotype Likelihoods (snpADCall --gl). Thanks to Swapan Mallick 
  for requesting this.
- Fix: running with --no_repeat does not reestimate error profile

0.3.2
- Bam2snpAD option --merge_ends to assume identical error profiles for 3' and 5' ends 
  (request by anonymous reviewer).

0.3.1
- snpAD option --fast to estimate only ts and tv (inspired by referee question). 
- Bam2snpAD options --min_qual and --max_qual to limit both minimum and maximum 
  quality of reads considered. Allows error profiles to be estimated separately
  for bins of quality (inspired by referee question)
- Estimate base composition not as a score (sum of probabilities for a given base over 
  all reads) but as an actual likelihood (product of probabilities). Thanks to 
  Fernando Racimo for pointing that out. 

0.3.0
- Release for snpAD publication.
